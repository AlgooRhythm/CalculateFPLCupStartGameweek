# CalculateFPLCupStartGameweek

About this code

This snippet Python (run on Jupyter notebook) codes help to determine when will the FPL cup start based on current registered FPL managers 
(grab from FPL API "https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/"). 

This codes also give the count of remaining FPL managers needed, in order to start FPL Cup in the next previous gameweek.
